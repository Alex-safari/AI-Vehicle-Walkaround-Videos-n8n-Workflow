## Overview
This workflow is the complete system behind the **AI Vehicle Walkaround Video Generator**. It transforms **5 simple photos** (3 of a car, 1 of a dealership, 1 of a salesperson) into a complete, 3-scene, 24-second video advertisement‚Äîfor a total cost of **$0.93 per video**.

It uses an "AI Salesperson" agent to analyze all visual data, write a unique script, and generate a high-quality video with a **consistent character** using **Google Veo 3.1**.

## Workflow Breakdown

*This workflow is designed to be triggered in two ways:*
1.  **Form Trigger:** A form to upload the 5 images and car details (Make, Model), which populates a Google Sheet with a "Pending" status.
2.  **Schedule Trigger:** Runs daily, reads the Google Sheet, and processes the first "Pending" job it finds.

### 1. Read Database
- **Trigger:** Reads a Google Sheet (`Car Dealership Promo Video`) to find the first row with a "Status" of "Pending".
- **Output:** Fetches all 5 image URLs and the vehicle metadata (Make, Model, ID).

### 2. Parallel AI Vision (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- The workflow runs 5 separate **Gemini 2.5 Pro** vision nodes in parallel.
- Each node analyzes one of the 5 reference images (Scene 1, Scene 2, Scene 3, Dealership, Character) using an advanced YAML prompt.
- **Result:** Generates 5 exhaustive YAML descriptions detailing everything from car paint color to the salesperson's clothing and the dealership's architecture.

### 3. Log Descriptions
- The 5 YAML descriptions are aggregated and updated back to the Google Sheet. This provides a clear log of the AI's "vision" step.

### 4. "AI Salesperson" Agent (GPT-4.1)
- **Node:** `Veo Creative Director and Scriptwriter`
- This is the "brain" of the operation. It receives all 5 YAML descriptions and the car's Make/Model.
- **Action:** The GPT-4.1 agent writes a unique, persuasive 3-scene script (Intro, Features, CTA) designed for an 8-second clip.
- **Output:** It structures all this data into a JSON object with 3 separate, highly-detailed prompts, one for each scene, ensuring a **consistent character in Veo 3 n8n**.

### 5. Generate 3 Video Scenes (Google Veo 3.1)
- The 3-scene JSON is split into 3 separate items.
- Each item is passed to the `Kie.ai VEO3.1 fast image to video subworkflow`.
- This is the core of the **Google Veo 3.1 image to video n8n** process, generating three 8-second video clips.

### 6. Stitch Final Video (FFMPEG)
- The 3 video URLs from Veo 3.1 are aggregated into a single array.
- This array is sent to the `Fal.ai FFMPEG Merge Videos` subworkflow.
- **Result:** A single, seamless 24-second **Veo 3 advertisement n8n** video.

### 7. Upload & Finalize
- **Download:** The final merged video is downloaded from the FFMPEG URL.
- **Upload:** The video file is uploaded to Google Drive ("Car Promo Videos" folder).
- **Update Database:** The final Google Drive link is saved to the original Google Sheet row, and the "Status" is updated to "Done".
